# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions for the Advent of Code 2023, 
see https://adventofcode.com/2023
Line counts exclude blank lines and comments, and utility functions in utils.go

* **Day 1** (Go): Find digits in a string, come first and last digit on each
  line to make a number, and add these up. For part 2, look for embedded names
  of numbers as well, complicated as last & first letters are shared if they
  are the same.  Problem description (*easy*)

To compile and run a **Go** program
* Change into the directory with the program
* `go mod init day01`  (*only if go.mod does not yet exist*)
* `go build`
* `./day01`  (or whatever name of the executable)

To run a **Python** program
* Change into the directory with the program
* `python day06.py`
